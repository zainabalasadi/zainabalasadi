# Zainab Alasadi âœ¨

Hi there, I'm Zainabâ€”currently a user experience researcher and designer at Wriveted, helping children find books they love. Previously, I was exploring interactions between humans and robots at UNSWâ€™s HCI BoDI lab, scaling design systems at Macquarie Bank, and studied Computer Science and Media Arts at UNSW.

## Things I'm currently thinking about
- ðŸ“™ Design ethics and futures
- ðŸ§  Trustworthy machine learning systems (peep this [paper](https://publications.csiro.au/publications/publication/PIcsiro:EP205485) published by my coworker)
- ðŸ¤  More [cowboy emojis](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/15QZNIvkY9wbEBkUsHnfjjHXwOnApniIx?usp=drive_open)
